# Day 23: Last digit of a large number

- [Last digit of a large number | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5511b2f550906349a70004e1)

## Problem description

Define a function that takes in two non-negative integers $a$ and $b$ and returns the last decimal digit of $a^b$. Note that $a$ and $b$ may be very large!

For example, the last decimal digit of $9^7$ is $9$, since $9^7=47829699$. The last decimal digit of $(2^{200})^{2^{300}}$ , which has over $10^{92}$ decimal digits, is $6$. Also, please take $0^0$ to be $1$.

You may assume that the input will always be valid.

### Examples

```text
last_digit(4, 1)                -> 4
last_digit(4, 2)                -> 6
last_digit(9, 7)                -> 9
last_digit(10, 10 ** 10)        -> 0
last_digit(2 ** 200, 2 ** 300)  -> 6
```

## Resolution

This was a fun one :)

The last digit of any integer is equivalent to ask for the remainder of the division by 10 of the number.

Since numbers might be very large, an aproximation by using the `%` operator doesn't work.

Using [Fermat's little theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem) and the [Chinese remainder theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem) we can solve this problem in a much more efficient way.

## Code

```python
def last_digit(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return 1

    # Using Fermat's Little Theorem and the Chinese Remainder Theorem
    r1 = a % 2
    r2 = a % 5
    r3 = b % 4

    # Remainder mod 2
    if a % 2 == 0:
        c1 = 0
    else:
        c1 = 1

    # Remainder mod 5
    if r2 == 0 and r3 == 0:
        c2 = 0
    else:
        c2 = (r2 ** r3) % 5

    # Search the remainder of 10 that satisfies the both calculated above
    posibles_restos = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    i = 0
    while (i < len(posibles_restos) and (posibles_restos[i] % 2 != c1 or posibles_restos[i] % 5 != c2)):
        i += 1

    return posibles_restos[i]
```
