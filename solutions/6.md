## Problem description

Given a string, each word containing a number. We need to sort the string using these numbers as positions in the result.

### Examples

```text
"is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
"4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2"  -->  "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"
""  -->  ""
```

## Resolution

Create an array with the sentence words using the `split` method, with regular expression extract the number in each word and use that number to insert the element in the array.

## Code

```python
import re

def order(sentence):
    if sentence == "":
        res = ""
    else:
        words = sentence.split(" ")
        res = [0] * len(words)
        for w in words:
            position = int(re.findall("(\d)", w)[0]) - 1
            res[position] = w
        res = " ".join(res)
    return res
```
