# Day 57: Snail

- [Snail | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/521c2db8ddc89b9b7a0000c1)

## Problem description

Given an `n x n` array, return the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.

### Examples

```text
array = [[1,2,3],
         [4,5,6],
         [7,8,9]]
snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

## Resolution

The solution I designed splits in three functions:

1. The main function: `snail`. It takes the input and while the number of elements of the resulting array is less than the number of items of the given input executes the following code.
2. `get_perimeter_of_matrix`. Takes the matrix and return an array with the elements in it's border, clockwise.
3. `cut_snail`. Takes the matrix and return the same matrix without the items in it's border.

Then, using (2) and (3) until the resulting array has the same number of elements than the given matrix solves the problem.

## Code

```python
def get_perimeter_of_matrix(matrix):
    if len(matrix) == 1:
        return matrix[0]
    top = matrix[0]
    right = [r[-1] for r in matrix[1:-1]]
    bottom = matrix[-1][::-1]
    left = [r[0] for r in matrix[1:-1][::-1]]
    return top + right + bottom + left

def cut_snail(matrix):
    res = matrix[1:-1]
    res = [x[1:-1] for x in res]
    return res

def snail(snail_map):
    if len(snail_map) == 1:
        return snail_map[0]
    res = []
    target = len(snail_map) ** 2
    while len(res) < target:
        per = get_perimeter_of_matrix(snail_map)
        snail_map = cut_snail(snail_map)
        res += per
    return res
```
