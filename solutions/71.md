# Day 71: Playing with digits

- [Playing with digits | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5552101f47fc5178b1000050)

## Problem description

Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p:

- We want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such that the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k \* n.

### Examples

```text
(89, 1) -> 1
(92, 1) -> -1
(695, 2) -> 2
(46288, 3) -> 51
```

## Resolution

Get all the digits of the number and calculate the sum of all digits taken to the powers of p.

Then check if the remainder of the division of the sum by the given number is equal to zero, meaning exists the wanted integer $k$

## Code

```python
def dig_pow(n, p):
    digits = [int(x) for x in str(n)]
    s = sum([digits[i]**(p+i) for i in range(len(digits))])
    if s % n == 0:
        return s / n
    else:
        return -1
```
