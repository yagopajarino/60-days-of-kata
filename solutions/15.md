# Day 15: Printer Errors

- [Printer Errors | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56541980fa08ab47a0000040)

## Problem description

In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

### Examples

```text
"aaabbbbhaijjjm" -> "0/14"
"aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm" -> "8/22"
```

## Resolution

We need to count all the letters in the string that are not in the range [a-m]

In python we can simply check this by asking if a char is greater (>) than `"m"`.

So, for each char in the string, if it is greater than `"m"`, we add one to a variable `counter`.

## Code

```python
def printer_error(s):
    counter = 0
    for x in s:
        if x > "m":
            counter += 1
    return str(counter) + "/" + str(len(s))
```
