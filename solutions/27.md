# Day 27: Rot13

- [Rot13 | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/530e15517bc88ac656000716)

## Problem description

ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is an example of the Caesar cipher.

Create a function that takes a string and returns the string ciphered with Rot13. If there are numbers or special characters included in the string, they should be returned as they are. Only letters from the latin/english alphabet should be shifted, like in the original Rot13 "implementation".

### Examples

```text
"test" -> "grfg"
"Test" -> "Grfg"
```

## Resolution

For each char in `message`, we need to replace it with the letter 13 times after it. So we can create two const `MINS` and `MAYS` with all the letters and use them as translators.

Then iterate over the `message` and find the letter 13 positions after each char. Note the `%` operator used to solve the out of range problem that can cause.

## Code

```python
MINS = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
MAYS = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
N_SHIFT = 13

def rot13(message):
    res = ""
    for x in message:
        if x in MINS:
            res += MINS[(MINS.index(x) + N_SHIFT) % 26]
        elif x in MAYS:
            res += MAYS[(MAYS.index(x) + N_SHIFT) % 26]
        else:
            res += x
    return res
```
