# Day 90: Directions Reduction

- [Directions Reduction | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/550f22f4d758534c1100025a)

## Problem description

Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild mountainous west…

… a man was given directions to go from one point to another. The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST". Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too.

Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction right away is a needless effort. Since this is the wild west, with dreadful weather and not much water, it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!

Write a function `dirReduc` which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).

### Examples

```text
["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"] -> ['WEST']
["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"] -> ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"]
```

## Resolution

For each element in the array, check if the next one is opposite to it, if so delete both and return back to the first element, otherwise move forward in the array.

## Code

```python
def dirReduc(arr):
    i = 0
    while i < len(arr) - 1:
        actual = arr[i]
        sig = arr[i+1]
        if  (actual, sig) == ("NORTH", "SOUTH") or \
        (actual, sig) == ("SOUTH", "NORTH") or \
        (actual, sig) == ("EAST", "WEST") or \
        (actual, sig) == ("WEST", "EAST"):
            del arr[i]
            del arr[i]
            i = 0
        else:
            i += 1
    return arr
```
