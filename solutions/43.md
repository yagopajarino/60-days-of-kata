# Day 43: Find the unique number

- [Find the unique number | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/585d7d5adb20cf33cb000235)

## Problem description

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

### Examples

```text
[ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ] -> 2
[ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ] -> 0.55
```

## Resolution

Solved without using set or count functions.

The first thing we need to find is the repeated element, in order to compare it to the rest of the array.

Using the first three elements we can find it, comparing them two by two.

Then we can loop over the array until finding the distinct element, and return it.

## Code

```python
def find_uniq(arr):
    a = arr[0]
    b = arr[1]
    c = arr[2]
    if a == b and b != c:
        return c
    elif a == c and b != c:
        return b
    elif b == c and c != a:
        return a
    else:
        i = 3
        while i < len(arr) and arr[i] == a:
            i += 1
        return arr[i]
```
