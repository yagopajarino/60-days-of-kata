# Day 35: Complementary DNA

- [Complementary DNA | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/554e4a2f232cdd87d9000038)

## Problem description

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA; you need to return the other complementary side.

### Examples

```text
"ATTGC" -> "TAACG"
"GTAT" -> "CATA"
```

## Resolution

We create a translate `tr` dictionary with all the possible changes in the given string. Then, for each char in `dna` we need to find the value given by the `tr` dict to that char and add it to a new list.

After getting all the complementary chars, we return the string resulting of join all the elements of the list.

## Code

```python
def DNA_strand(dna):
    tr = {
        "A": "T",
        "T": "A",
        "C": "G",
        "G": "C"
    }
    return "".join([tr[x] for x in dna])
```
