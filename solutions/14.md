# Day 14: Bit Counting

- [Bit Counting | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/526571aae218b8ee490006f4)

## Problem description

Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

### Examples

```text
1234 -> 5
12525589 -> 11
3811 -> 8
```

## Resolution

The [binary notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) of a number is made using the successive remainders of the division by two.

A possible algorithm successively divides the input by two and count the number of remainders equal to one while the number is greater than zero.

## Code

```C++
unsigned int countBits(unsigned long long n) {
  unsigned int res = 0;
  while (n > 0) {
    if (n % 2 == 1) {
      res++;
    }
    n /= 2;
  }
  return res;
}
```
