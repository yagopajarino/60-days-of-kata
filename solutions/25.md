# Day 25: Highest and Lowest

- [Highest and Lowest | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/554b4ac871d6813a03000035)

## Problem description

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

### Examples

```text
"1 2 3 4 5" -> "5 1"
"1 2 -3 4 5" -> "5 -3"
"1 9 3 4 -5" -> "9 -5"
```

## Resolution

First we need to extract the numbers from the given strin. To do so I used the string's split method.

Once we have an array with all the numbers, iterate over it to find the min and the max (I could use the built-in min and max but it wasn't much fun).

After that, return the max and min values joined in a string.

## Code

```python
def high_and_low(numbers):
    numbers = [int(x) for x in numbers.split(" ")]
    min = numbers[0]
    max = numbers[0]
    for x in numbers:
        if x < min:
            min = x
        elif x > max:
            max = x

    return " ".join([str(max), str(min)])
```
