# Day 78: How good are you really?

- [How good are you really? | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5601409514fc93442500010b)

## Problem description

There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

Return `True` if you're better, else `False`!

### Examples

```text
[2, 3], 5 -> True
[100, 40, 34, 57, 29, 72, 57, 88], 75 -> True
[41, 75, 72, 56, 80, 82, 81, 33], 50 -> False
```

## Resolution

Return true if the given score is greater than the mean of the given array.

## Code

```python
import statistics

def better_than_average(class_points, your_points):
    return statistics.mean(class_points) < your_points
```
