# Day 28: The Hashtag Generator

- [The Hashtag Generator | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52449b062fb80683ec000024)

## Problem description

The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:

- It must start with a hashtag (#).
- All words must have their first letter capitalized.
- If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
- If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.

### Examples

```text
" Hello there thanks for trying my Kata" -> "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"
"    Hello     World   " -> "#HelloWorld"
"" -> false
```

## Resolution

Split the string into individual words and then join them capitalized.

If the resulting string `tag` lenght is equal to zero or greater than 140 return `False` else return the hashtag.

## Code

```python
def generate_hashtag(s):
    words = s.split()
    tag = "".join([x.capitalize() for x in words])
    if len(tag) > 140 or len(tag) == 0:
        return False
    else:
        return "#" + tag
```
