# Day 72: Length of missing array

- [Length of missing array | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57b6f5aadb5b3d0ae3000611)

## Problem description

You get an array of arrays.
If you sort the arrays by their length, you will see, that their length-values are consecutive.
But one array is missing!

You have to write a method, that return the length of the missing array.

If the array of arrays is null/nil or empty, the method should return 0.

When an array in the array is null or empty, the method should return 0 too!
There will always be a missing element and its length will be always between the given arrays.

### Examples

```text
[[1, 2], [4, 5, 1, 1], [1], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]] -> 3
[[5, 2, 9], [4, 5, 1, 1], [1], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]] -> 2
[[None], [None, None, None]] -> 2
[['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a','a', 'a']] -> 5
```

## Resolution

First check the cases where the method must return 0. That is if the given array is empty, or any of it's elements is `None` or is empty.

Then loop over the array until finding that the length of two consecutives arrays is greater than one.

## Code

```python
def exists_null_or_empty(a):
    for x in a:
        if x == None or len(x) == 0:
            return True
    return False

def get_length_of_missing_array(a):
    if len(a) == 0 or exists_null_or_empty(a):
        return 0
    s = sorted(a, key=len)
    i = 0
    while i < len(s)-1 and len(s[i]) + 1 == len(s[i+1]):
        i += 1
    return len(s[i]) + 1
```
