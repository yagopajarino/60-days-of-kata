# Day 76: Count IP Adresses

- [Count IP Addresses | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/526989a41034285187000de4)

## Problem description

Implement a function that receives two IPv4 addresses, and returns the number of addresses between them (including the first one, excluding the last one).

All inputs will be valid IPv4 addresses in the form of strings. The last address will always be greater than the first one.

### Examples

```text
"10.0.0.0", "10.0.0.50" -> 50
"10.0.0.0", "10.0.1.0" -> 256
"20.0.0.10", "20.0.1.0" -> 246
```

## Resolution

This [IPv4 article](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) helped me to understand how IP4 adresses exists.

Then, to calculate how many adresses are between two, get the digits in each IP, calculate the difference between both i-th digits and multiply if for 256 to the i-th power.

## Code

```python
def ips_between(start, end):
    start = list(map(int, start.split(".")))
    end = list(map(int, end.split(".")))
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        res += (end[i] - start[i]) * (256 ** (4-i-1))
    return res
```
