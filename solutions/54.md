# Day 54: Luck check

- [Luck check | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5314b3c6bb244a48ab00076c)

## Problem description

In some countries of former Soviet Union there was a belief about lucky tickets. A transport ticket of any sort was believed to posess luck if sum of digits on the left half of its number was equal to the sum of digits on the right half.

Your task is to write a funtion `luck_check(str)`, which returns `True` if argument is string decimal representation of a lucky ticket number, or `False` for all other numbers. It should throw errors for empty strings or strings which don't represent a decimal number.

### Examples

```text
003111 -> True
813372 -> True
12345678 -> False
```

## Resolution

First set the boundaries of the substrings to sum. The first substring to sum will go from the beggining to lenght // 2.

If the string's length is even, the second substring will go from the previous calculated boundarie to the end of the string, otherwise will go from `length // 2 + 1` to the end of the string.

## Code

```python
def luck_check(string):
    partOne = len(string) // 2
    partTwo = partOne if len(string) % 2 == 0 else partOne + 1
    return sum(int(x) for x in string[:partOne]) == sum(int(x) for x in string[partTwo:])
```
