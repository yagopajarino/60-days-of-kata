# Day 12: Find the missing term in an Arithmetic Progression

- [Find the missing term in an Arithmetic Progression | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52de553ebb55d1fca3000371/)

## Problem description

An Arithmetic Progression is defined as one in which there is a constant difference between the consecutive terms of a given series of numbers. You are provided with consecutive elements of an Arithmetic Progression. There is however one hitch: exactly one term from the original series is missing from the set of numbers which have been given to you. The rest of the given series is the same as the original AP. Find the missing term.

You have to write a function that receives a list, list size will always be at least 3 numbers. The missing term will never be the first or last one.

### Examples

```text
[1, 3, 5, 9, 11] --> 7
[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] --> 2
```

## Resolution

The description says that the first and last term are always correct. Then, we can define the progression interval as

`interval = (last_item - first_item) / length_of_sequence`

The we look for the first term of the sequence which difference to it's next neighbor is not equal to the calculated interval and return the terms plus the interval.

## Code

```python
def find_missing(sequence):
    interval = (sequence[-1] - sequence[0]) / len(sequence)
    i = 0
    while sequence[i+1] - sequence[i] == interval:
        i += 1
    return sequence[i] + interval
```
