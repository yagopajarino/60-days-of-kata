# Day 79: Equal Sides Of An Array 

- [Equal Sides Of An Array | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5679aa472b8f57fb8c000047)

## Problem description

You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

### Examples

```text
[1,2,3,4,3,2,1] -> 3
[1,100,50,-51,1,1] -> 1
[10,-80,10,10,15,35,20] -> 6
```

## Resolution

For each element in the array, calculate the sum of all values at it's right and left until finding both sums are equal.

## Code

```python
def find_even_index(arr):
    i = 0
    while i < len(arr) and sum(arr[i:]) - arr[i] != sum(arr[:i]):
        i += 1
    return -1 if i == len(arr) else i
```
