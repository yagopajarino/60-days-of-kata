# Day 84: Permute a Palindrome

- [Training on Permute a Palindrome | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58ae6ae22c3aaafc58000079/train/python)

## Problem description

Write a function that will check whether ANY permutation of the characters of the input string is a palindrome. Bonus points for a solution that is efficient and/or that uses only built-in language functions. Deem yourself brilliant if you can come up with a version that does not use any function whatsoever.

### Examples

```text
madam -> True
adamm -> True
junk -> False
```

## Resolution

There can be at least one char with an odd count of appearances in the input. Therefore return false only if there is more than one char with an odd count.

## Code

```python
def permute_a_palindrome (input):
    letters = list(set(input))
    odd = 0
    for x in letters:
        if input.count(x) % 2 != 0:
            if odd == 1:
                return False
            else:
                odd += 1
    return True
```
