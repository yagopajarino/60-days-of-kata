# Day 47: Perimeter of squares in a rectangle

- [Training on Perimeter of squares in a rectangle | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/559a28007caad2ac4e000083)

## Problem description

The drawing shows 6 squares the sides of which have a length of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. It's easy to see that the sum of the perimeters of these squares is : 4 _ (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8) = 4 _ 20 = 80

Could you give the sum of the perimeters of all the squares in a rectangle when there are n + 1 squares disposed in the same manner as in the drawing:

The function perimeter has for parameter n where n + 1 is the number of squares (they are numbered from 0 to n) and returns the total perimeter of all the squares.

### Examples

```text
5 -> 80
7 -> 216
```

## Resolution

For a given `n` we need to calculate the sum of the first n terms in the fibonacci sequence. The auxiliar function `sum_fibos` does so.

As shown in the example, return 4 times the sum of the first n terms in the Fibonacci sequence, using the `sum_fibos` method.

## Code

```python
def sum_fibos(n):
    f = [1,1]
    for x in range(2,n+1):
        f.append(f[x-2] + f[x-1])
    return sum(f)

def perimeter(n):
    return 4 * sum_fibos(n)
```
