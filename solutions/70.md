# Day 70: Tic-Tac-Toe Checker

- [Tic-Tac-Toe Checker | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/525caa5c1bf619d28c000335)

## Problem description

If we were to set up a Tic-Tac-Toe game, we would want to know whether the board's current state is solved, wouldn't we? Our goal is to create a function that will check that for us!

Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the value is 0 if a spot is empty, 1 if it is an "X", or 2 if it is an "O".

We want our function to return:

- -1 if the board is not yet finished AND no one has won yet (there are empty spots),
- 1 if "X" won,
- 2 if "O" won,
- 0 if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw).

You may assume that the board passed in is valid in the context of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

### Examples

## Resolution

Using primes and the Fundamental theorem of arithmetic :)

Assign a prime to each cell, then calculate each player score by multiplying the primes of it's cells.

Then check if any of the winning scores divides the player's score. If so the player won.

If none of the winning scores divides the players score, then there is no winner. If zeros if not equal to zero then the game has not ended and return -1. Else return 0.

## Code

```python
def calculate_scores(board):
    primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23]
    s1, s2 = 1,1
    z = 0
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == 1:
                s1 *= primes[3*i + j]
            elif board[i][j] == 2:
                s2 *= primes[3*i + j]
            else:
                z += 1
    return s1, s2, z

def is_winner(score):
    winners = [2*3*5, 7*11*13, 17*19*23, 2*7*17, 3*11*19, 5*13*23, 2*11*23, 5*11*17]
    for x in winners:
        if score % x == 0:
            return True
    return False

def is_solved(board):
    score1, score2, zeros = calculate_scores(board)
    if is_winner(score1):
        return 1
    elif is_winner(score2):
        return 2
    elif zeros == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return -1
```
