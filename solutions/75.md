# Day 75: Double Char

- [Double Char | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56b1f01c247c01db92000076)

## Problem description

Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

### Examples

```text
"String" -> "SSttrriinngg"
"Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
"1234!_ " -> "11223344!!__  "
```

## Resolution

Using comprehension lists, create the list with each char of s doubled. Then join all the elements in it with the "" separator.

## Code

```python
def double_char(s):
    return "".join([2*x for x in s])
```
