# Day 56: Regex validate PIN code

- [Regex validate PIN code | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55f8a9c06c018a0d6e000132)

## Problem description

ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return `true`, else return `false`.

### Examples

```text
"1234" -> true
"12345" -> false
"a234" -> false
```

## Resolution

The first solution I proposed was to check if the lenght of the given string is 4 or 6 and if every char in it is a digit.

But checking the kata tags I found out it was intended to be solved using regular expressions, so I to go back and try this way.

## Code

```python
# Without regex
def validate_pin(pin):
    return pin.isdigit() and (len(pin) in {4,6})
```

```python
# With regex
import re

def validate_pin(pin):
    return re.fullmatch(r"^\d{4}(?:\d{2})?$", pin) != None
```
