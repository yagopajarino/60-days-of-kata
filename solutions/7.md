# Day 7: Human Readable Time

- [Human Readable Time | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52685f7382004e774f0001f7)

## Problem description

Given a non-negative integer, return a human readable time string with the format `HH:MM:SS`

### Examples

```text
5 --> "00:00:05"
60 --> "00:01:00"
86399 --> "23:59:59"
```

## Resolution

The intuition to solve this was something like

> I know that 60 seconds is equal to 1 minute and 60 minutes are equal to 1 hour

So in terms of seconds:

- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- 1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds

Using the division algorithm we can find how many hours fit in the given seconds an the remaining ones to use when calculating the minutes. Using the same logic we get the seconds.

## Code

```python
def make_readable(seconds):
    res = []
    splits = [60*60, 60, 1]
    for x in splits:
        res.append(seconds // x)
        seconds %= x
    return ":".join([str(x).zfill(2) for x in res])
```
