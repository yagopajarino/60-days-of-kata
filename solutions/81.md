- [Write Number in Expanded Form | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5842df8ccbd22792a4000245)

## Problem description

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in Expanded Form.

### Examples

```text
12 -> "10 + 2"
42 -> "40 + 2"
70304 -> "70000 + 300 + 4"
```

## Resolution

Append each of the number's digits to an array, multiplied by 10 powered to its position in the number.

Then return the numbers in the array joined with the " + " string

## Code

```python
def expanded_form(num):
    res = []
    i = 0
    while num > 0:
        d = num % 10
        if d != 0:
            res.append(str(d * (10**i)))
        num = num // 10
        i += 1
    return " + ".join(res[::-1])
```
