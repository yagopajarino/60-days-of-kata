- [5 without numbers !! | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59441520102eaa25260000bf)

## Problem description

Write a function that always returns 5

Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: `0123456789*+-/`

## Resolution

Looking up a way to return the number five without using numbers, I tried using the ord function and then came up with returning the len of a string of len five.

## Code

```python

```
