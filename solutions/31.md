# Day 31: Number of trailing zeros of N!

- [Number of trailing zeros of N! | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52f787eb172a8b4ae1000a34)

## Problem description

Write a program that will calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a given number.

### Examples

```text
6 -> 1
12 -> 2
30 -> 7
```

## Resolution

Yep, other math and algorithms problem. :)

Factorials get really big for pretty low values of $n$ ($1000!$ has 2568 digits). Therefore, calculating the factorial of $n$ and looking how many zeros it has was not an option.

A factorial by definition is the product of $n$ numbers. Furthermore, each number can be described as a product of primes, as the [fundamental theorem of arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic) states.

Any given number has as many trailing zeros as power of 10 it has on it's factorization.

Then, we need to find the power of five the factorial will have. (Since this one is going to be less than the power of two)

The algorithm will sum the power five for each number in $[1,n]$.

## Code

```python
def zeros(n):
    res = 0
    pow_of_five = 5
    while pow_of_five <= n:
        res += n // pow_of_five
        pow_of_five *= 5
    return res
```
