# Day 5: Sort the odd

- [Sort the odd | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/578aa45ee9fd15ff4600090d/)

## Problem description

Given an array of integer, sort the odd numbers in ascending order while leaving the even numbers at their original positions.

### Examples

```text
[7, 1]  =>  [1, 7]
[5, 8, 6, 3, 4]  =>  [3, 8, 6, 5, 4]
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]  =>  [1, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9, 0]
```

## Resolution

Create a new array with the odd numbers. Sort it and replace the original odd numbers of the input with the new sorted numbers.

## Code

```python
def sort_array(a):
    odds = sorted([x for x in a if x % 2 == 1])
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < len(a):
        if a[i] % 2 == 1:
            a[i] = odds[j]
            j += 1
        i += 1
    return a
```
