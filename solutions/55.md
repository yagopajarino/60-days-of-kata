# Day 55: 1RM Calculator

- [1RM Calculator | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/595bbea8a930ac0b91000130)

## Problem description

You just got done with your set at the gym, and you are wondering how much weight you could lift if you did a single repetition. Thankfully, a few scholars have devised formulas for this purpose.

### Epley

$1RM = w\left(1+\frac{r}{30}\right)$

### McGlothin

$1RM = \frac{100w}{101.3-2.67123r}$

### Lombardi

$1RM = wr^{0.10}$

Your function will receive a weight w and a number of repetitions r and must return your projected one repetition maximum. Since you are not sure which formula to use and you are feeling confident, your function will return the largest value from the three formulas shown above, rounded to the nearest integer. However, if the number of repetitions passed in is 1 (i.e., it is already a one rep max), your function must return w. Also, if the number of repetitions passed in is 0 (i.e., no repetitions were completed), your function must return 0.

### Examples

```text
135,20 -> 282
200,8 -> 253
270,2 -> 289
```

## Resolution

First check wether the reps are 0 or 1 and, if so, return its correponding value.

Then calculate the value for each function and return the max of the three, rounded.

## Code

```python
def calculate_1RM(w, r):
    if r == 1:
        return w
    elif r == 0:
        return r
    else:
        e = w*(1 + r/30)
        m = 100*w / (101.3-2.67123*r)
        l = w*(r**0.1)
    return round(max(e,m,l))
```
