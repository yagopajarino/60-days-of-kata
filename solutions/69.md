# Day 69: Persistent Bugger.

- [Persistent Bugger. | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55bf01e5a717a0d57e0000ec)

## Problem description

Write a function, `persistence`, that takes in a positive parameter `num` and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in `num` until you reach a single digit.

### Examples

```text
39 -> 3
999 -> 4
4 -> 0
```

## Resolution

Loop over the number digits array multiplicating it's digits, until it's length gets equal to 1.

## Code

```python
from math import prod

def persistence(n):
    n = [int(c) for c in str(n)]
    c = 0
    while len(n) > 1:
        n = [int(c) for c in str(prod(n))]
        c += 1
    return c
```
