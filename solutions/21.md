# Day 21: Remove the minimum

- [Remove the minimum | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/563cf89eb4747c5fb100001b)

## Problem description

Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

### Examples

```text
[1,2,3,4,5] -> [2,3,4,5]
[5,3,2,1,4] -> [5,3,2,4]
[2,2,1,2,1] -> [2,2,2,1]
```

## Resolution

I challenged myself to solve this one without using any get-the-min built in functions.

A loop over the `numbers` array to find the min value, in each iteration asking if the i-th value in the array is less than the `min` value, equal to the first elemento of the array at the beginning of the loop. If it's less, save that index in the `min` variable.

After finding the index of the minimum value in the array, we can use the great python's slicing habilities to return the new array.

## Code

```python
def remove_smallest(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        res = []
    else:
        i = 1
        min = 0
        while i < len(numbers):
            if numbers[i] < numbers[min]:
                min = i
            i += 1
        res = numbers[:min] + numbers[min+1:]

    return res
```
