# Day 2: Power of Two

- [Power of two | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/534d0a229345375d520006a0/)

## Problem description

Simple: given an non negative integer, return `True` if and only if it is a power of two.

The math definition of a power of two is:

$k \in \mathbb{Z}$ is power of two $ \iff \exists n \in \mathbb{Z} : k = 2^n $

## Resolution

At first glance, you would like to use the opposite operation of exponential, logarithmics.

Such aproximation would determine a number (k) is power of two if $log_2(k) \in \mathbb{Z}$

That was my first try at solving the kata. Tried to solve it using the math.log() function but I had some (expected) rounding errors. Time to look for something else.

So I took the above definition and implemented an algorithm which looks for the number $n$ that (if exists) asserts that $k = 2^n$

# Code

```python
def power_of_two(x):
    n = 0
    while 2 ** n < x:
        n += 1
    return 2 ** n == x
```
