# Day 16: Count of positives / sum of negatives

- [Count of positives / sum of negatives | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/576bb71bbbcf0951d5000044/)

## Problem description

Given an array of integers.

Return an array, where the first element is the count of positives numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers. 0 is neither positive nor negative.

If the input is an empty array or is null, return an empty array.

### Examples

```text
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15] -> [10, -65]
[0, 2, 3, 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, -11, -12, -13, -14] -> [8, 50]
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> [0,0]
```

## Resolution

If the given array has lenght equal to zero, return the `[]` empty array.

Create the `pos` array: iterate over the given `arr` and filter the numbers greater than 0

Create the `neg` array: iterate over the given `arr` and filter the numbers less than 0

Return the `[pos, neg]` array.

## Code

```python
def count_positives_sum_negatives(arr):
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return []
    pos = len([x for x in arr if x > 0])
    neg = sum([x for x in arr if x < 0])
    return [pos, neg]
```
