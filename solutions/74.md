# Day 74: Mumbling

- [Mumbling | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5667e8f4e3f572a8f2000039)

## Problem description

This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

### Examples

```text
accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
```

## Resolution

First create an array with words that need to be joined at the returning string.

Then, join the words in the array with the "-" delimiter and each one capitalized.

## Code

```python
def accum(s):
    res = []
    for i in range(len(s)):
        res.append(s[i].lower() * (i+1))
    return "-".join([x.capitalize() for x in res])
```
