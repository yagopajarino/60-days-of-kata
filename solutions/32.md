# Day 32: Simple Fun #52: Pair Of Shoes

- [Simple Fun #52: Pair Of Shoes | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58885a7bf06a3d466e0000e3)

## Problem description

Given an array of `shoe = [foot_indicator, size]` we need to check if it is posible to pair the shoes in such a way that each pair consists of a right and left foot of an equal size.

### Examples

```text
[[0, 21], [1, 23], [1, 21], [0, 23]] -> True
```

## Resolution

First I created a list with unique sizes. Then, for each size I want to know if for each left foot there is a right one. The `counter` var does so by adding or subtracting one depending on the foot.

If after checking all shoes for a given size, the count variable is not equal to zero, meaning there isn't a right foot for every left one, return `false`

## Code

```python
def pair_of_shoes(shoes):
    talles = list(set([x[1] for x in shoes]))
    for x in talles:
        count = 0
        for y in shoes:
            if y[1] == x:
                if y[0] == 0:
                    count += -1
                else:
                    count += 1
        if count != 0:
            return False
    return True
```
