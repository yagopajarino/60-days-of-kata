# Day 29: Weight for weight

- [Weight for weight | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55c6126177c9441a570000cc)

## Problem description

We are asked to sort an string of whitespace-separated numbers by the sum of it's digits. If two numbers have the same sum of digits order as if they were strings (alphabetically)

### Examples

```text
"56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" -> "100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"
```

## Resolution

Since we need to use one parameter to sort (sum_of_digits) and another one as return value (the orginal numbers) I created a list of tuples that will save the original number as string and the sum of it's digits for each number in the original string.

Then using the `key` property of the `sort` method, we can order by (1) sum of digits and (2) alphabetically.

## Code

```python
def sum_digits(n):
    if n < 10:
        return n
    else:
        return n % 10 + sum_digits(n // 10)


def order_weight(s):
    if s == "":
        return ""
    else:
        weights = [int(x) for x in s.split(" ")]
        data = [(str(x), sum_digits(x)) for x in weights]
        data.sort(key=(lambda x: (x[1], x[0])))
        return " ".join([x[0] for x in data])
```
