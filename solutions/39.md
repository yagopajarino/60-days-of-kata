# Day 39: Take a Ten Minutes Walk

## Problem description

You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You always walk only a single block for each letter (direction) and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.

### Examples

```text
['n','s','n','s','n','s','n','s','n','s'] -> True
['w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e'] -> False
['w'] -> False
```

## Resolution

The problem's goal is to identify is the length of the given array is equal to 10 (easy) and to verify that the directions cancel aout each other, returning to the original place after following them.

Usign prime numbers and The Fundamental Arithmetic Theorem, we can assign to each direction one prime, 2 for north/south and 3 for east/west. Then for each direction, multiply/divide a control variable and check if it remains equal to 1.

## Code

```python
def is_valid_walk(walk):
    res = 1
    for x in walk:
        if x == "n":
            res *= 2
        elif x == "s":
            res /= 2
        elif x == "w":
            res *= 3
        else:
            res /= 3
    return len(walk) == 10 and res == 1
```
