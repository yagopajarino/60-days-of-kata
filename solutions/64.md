# Day 64: Count the smiley faces!

- [Count the smiley faces! | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/583203e6eb35d7980400002a/)

## Problem description

Given an array (arr) as an argument complete the function countSmileys that should return the total number of smiling faces.

Rules for a smiling face:

- Each smiley face must contain a valid pair of eyes. Eyes can be marked as : or ;
- A smiley face can have a nose but it does not have to. Valid characters for a nose are - or ~
- Every smiling face must have a smiling mouth that should be marked with either ) or D

### Examples

```text
[':)', ';(', ';}', ':-D'] -> 2
[';D', ':-(', ':-)', ';~)'] -> 3
[';]', ':[', ';*', ':$', ';-D'] -> 1
```

## Resolution

Use the regular expression `^(?::|;){1}(?:-|~)*(\)|D){1}$` to find al the faces in the array.

## Code

````python
import re

def count_smileys(arr):
    reg = "^(?::|;){1}(?:-|~)*(\)|D){1}$"
    res = 0
    for x in arr:
        if re.match(reg, x) != None:
            res += 1
    return res
    ```
