# Day 24: DNA to RNA Conversion

- [DNA to RNA Conversion | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5556282156230d0e5e000089)

## Problem description

Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in biological systems. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T').

Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U').

Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.

### Examples

```text
"GCAT" -> "GCAU"
```

## Resolution

A simple replace challenge. Iterate over the given string, and when found a `'T'` replace it with a `'U'`

## Code

```C++
#include <string>

std::string DNAtoRNA(std::string dna){
  std::string res = "";
  int i = 0;
  while (i < dna.size()) {
    if (dna[i] == 'T') {
      res += "U";
    } else {
      res += dna[i];
    }
    i++;
  }
  return res;
}
```
