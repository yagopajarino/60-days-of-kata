# Day 83: Reverse every other word in the string

- [Reverse every other word in the string | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58d76854024c72c3e20000de)

## Problem description

Reverse every other word in a given string, then return the string. Throw away any leading or trailing whitespace, while ensuring there is exactly one space between each word. Punctuation marks should be treated as if they are a part of the word in this kata.

### Examples

```text
"Did it work?" -> "Did ti work?"
"Reverse this string, please!" -> "Reverse siht string, !esaelp"
"This is not a test " -> "This si not a test"
```

## Resolution

Create an array with the words in the string, the strip any whitespace and add it reversed (if it's on odd position) to a res array. Otherwise append the original word to the res array.

## Code

```python
def reverse_alternate(s):
    res = []
    words = s.split()
    for index, value in enumerate(words):
        word = value.strip()
        if index % 2 == 1:
            res.append(word[::-1])
        else:
            res.append(word)
    return " ".join(res)
```
