# Day 36: You're a square!

- [You're a square! | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54c27a33fb7da0db0100040e)

## Problem description

Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number.

### Examples

```text
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false
```

## Resolution

We can define a square number as that one whose square root is an integer.

To code that and avoid using methods like `is_integer` we can cast the square root of the given number as an `int` and ask if the power of 2 of that number returns the given one.

## Code

```python
def is_square(n):
    return n >= 0 and int(n ** (1/2)) ** 2 == n
```
