# Day 3: Who likes it?

- [Who likes it? | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5266876b8f4bf2da9b000362/)

## Problem description

We are given an array of strings, representing people names. We are requested to return a string like the one Facebook posts have.

The problem includes the expected result for arrays of length from 0 to 4 (and gives instruction for lengths greater than 4)

## Resolution

Looking the description examples I decided to code each possible length individually. So the algorithm ask for the input length and return the formatted string.

## Code

```python
def likes(names):
    n = len(names)
    if n == 0:
        return "no one likes this"
    elif n == 1:
        return names[0] + " likes this"
    elif n == 2:
        return " and ".join(names) + " like this"
    elif n == 3:
        return f"{names[0]}, {names[1]} and {names[2]} like this"
    else:
        return f"{names[0]}, {names[1]} and {n-2} others like this"
```
