# Day 52: Help the bookseller !

- [Help the bookseller ! | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54dc6f5a224c26032800005c)

## Problem description

A bookseller has lots of books classified in 26 categories labeled A, B, ... Z. Each book has a code c of 3, 4, 5 or more characters. The 1st character of a code is a capital letter which defines the book category.

In the bookseller's stocklist each code c is followed by a space and by a positive integer n (int n >= 0) which indicates the quantity of books of this code in stock.

You will be given a stocklist (e.g. : L) and a list of categories in capital letters and your task is to find all the books of L with codes belonging to each category of M and to sum their quantity according to each category.

### Examples

```text
["BBAR 150", "CDXE 515", "BKWR 250", "BTSQ 890", "DRTY 600"], ["A", "B", "C", "D"] -> "(A : 0) - (B : 1290) - (C : 515) - (D : 600)"
["ABAR 200", "CDXE 500", "BKWR 250", "BTSQ 890", "DRTY 600"], ["A", "B"] -> "(A : 200) - (B : 1140)"
```

## Resolution

The solution I implemented use a counter array where the i-th position has the book count of the i-th letter in the alphabet.

Then, using the given categories `cats`, I looked for the category count and add it to the resulting array.

At the end, print the elements of the `res` array as wanted.

## Code

```python
def stock_list(books, cats):
    if len(books) == 0 or len(cats) == 0:
        return ""
    books = [x.split(" ") for x in books]
    books = [(x[0], int(x[1])) for x in books]
    count = [0] * 26
    for x in books:
        count[ord(x[0][0]) - 65] += x[1]

    res = []
    for x in cats:
        res.append(f"({x} : {count[ord(x) - 65]})")
    return " - ".join(res)
```
