# Day 59: Sudoku Solver

- [Sudoku Solver | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5296bc77afba8baa690002d7)

## Problem description

Write a function that will solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The function will take one argument consisting of the 2D puzzle array, with the value 0 representing an unknown square.

### Examples

```text
puzzle = [[5,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,0],
          [6,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,0],
          [0,9,8,0,0,0,0,6,0],
          [8,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,3],
          [4,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,1],
          [7,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6],
          [0,6,0,0,0,0,2,8,0],
          [0,0,0,4,1,9,0,0,5],
          [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,7,9]]

sudoku(puzzle)
# Should return
 [[5,3,4,6,7,8,9,1,2],
  [6,7,2,1,9,5,3,4,8],
  [1,9,8,3,4,2,5,6,7],
  [8,5,9,7,6,1,4,2,3],
  [4,2,6,8,5,3,7,9,1],
  [7,1,3,9,2,4,8,5,6],
  [9,6,1,5,3,7,2,8,4],
  [2,8,7,4,1,9,6,3,5],
  [3,4,5,2,8,6,1,7,9]]
```

## Resolution

Solved using [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking)

The algorithm first checks if there is a position in zero and uses it as target. Then check if it's possible to assign a value between 1-9 to thet empty cell. If there is a number that can be placed there, places it and calls the function again until there are no places left to fill, obtaining the expected solution.

If at some point, there are empty cells but no number can be placed in the them, make the backtraking step, returning to the previuos state of the puzzle.

## Code
