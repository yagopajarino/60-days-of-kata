# Day 60: Find the missing letter

- [Find the missing letter | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5839edaa6754d6fec10000a2)

## Problem description

Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that returns the missing letter in the array.

You will always get an valid array. And it will be always exactly one letter missing. The length of the array will always be at least 2.
The array will always contain letters in only one case.

### Examples

```text
["a","b","c","d","f"] -> "e"
["O","Q","R","S"] -> "P"
```

## Resolution

For each letter in the given array, check if the next one in the alphabet (using the `ord` and `chr` methods) is equal to the next one in the array.

## Code

```python
def find_missing_letter(chars):
    for i in range(len(chars)-1):
        next_in_alph = chr(ord(chars[i]) + 1)
        if chars[i+1] != next_in_alph:
            return next_in_alph
```
