# Day 66: Estimating Amounts of Subsets

- [Estimating Amounts of Subsets | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/584703d76f6cf6ffc6000275)

## Problem description

Given a set of elements (integers or string characters, characters only in RISC-V) that may occur more than once, we need to know the amount of subsets that none of their values have repetitions.

### Examples

```text
[1, 2, 3, 4] -> 15
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd'] -> 15
```

## Resolution

In mathematics, the [power set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set) of a set $S$, is the set of all subsets of $S$ including the empty set $\emptyset$ and $S$ itself.

Therefore we know that the length of the powerset of any given set $S$ is equal to $2^{n}$ where n is the number of elements in $S$.

Since the description does not include the empty set as a subset of the given one, we may find $2^{n} - 1$ subsets of the set formed by the elements in the given array, that is, without duplicates.

## Code

```python
est_subsets = lambda arr: (2**len(set(arr))) -1
```
