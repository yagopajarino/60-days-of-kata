# Day 26: Friend or Foe?

- [Friend or Foe? | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55b42574ff091733d900002f)

## Problem description

Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

### Examples

```text
["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] -> ["Ryan", "Mark"]
```

## Resolution

For every item in the friends list, we need to ask if it's length is equal to four and filter those that are not. Using python [list comprehension](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list-comprehension/), the resolution takes one line.

## Code

```python
def friend(friends):
    return [x for x in friends if len(x) == 4]
```
