# Day 8: Growth of a Population

- [Growth of a Population | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/563b662a59afc2b5120000c6)

## Problem description

We need to find how many years may take to a small town to have a certain level of population.

The parameters we get are:

- The initial population `p0`
- The YoY population grow percentage `percent`
- The number of habitants that come or leave the city `aug`
- The population to surpass `p`

### Examples

```text
nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15
nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -> 10
```

## Resolution

Define $p_i$ as the population at year $i$

Recursively, we define $p_0=$ `p0` and $p_i = p_{i-1} * (1 + percent) + aug$

We need to find the $i \in \mathbb{Z}: p_i>=$ `p` and return that number $i$, the number of years needed to surpass the population `p`.

## Code

I decided to take some challenges on C++ :)

```C++
int nbYear(int p0, double percent, int aug, int p) {
    int i = 0;
    while (p0 < p) {
      p0 *= (1+percent/100);
      p0 += aug;
      i++;
    }
    return i;
}
```
