# Day 1: Two to One

- [Two to One | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5656b6906de340bd1b0000ac)

## Problem description

Two strings are given with chars from `a` to `z`. The return value must satisfy:

- Be the longest posible
- Be sorted
- Have no repeated chars
- All chars must be in one of the two given strings.

## Resolution

Let's call the two given strings `s1` and `s2`.

A simple algorithm would be:

1. Create a new string `s = s1+s2`
2. Create a new string `res = ""`
3. for x in s
   1. if x not in res
      1. add x to res
4. sort res

After step 3 we will have the longest posible string with unique chars. The only thing left is to sort res.

For sorting the output I used an adaptation of the [selection sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/) algorithm, that is, until your input is empty, in every iteration you look for the minimun value, add it to a new string and remove it from the input.

## Code

In this kata (and many others) I'll be trying to give two implementation code. One using fancy built-in functions and methods and other with basic elementary operations.

```python
# Long
def find_min_char(s):
    min = s[0]
    for x in s:
        if x < min:
            min = x
    return min


def sort(s):
    i = 0
    result = ""
    while len(s) > 0:
        min_char = find_min_char(s)
        result += min_char
        s = s.replace(min_char, "")
    return result

def longest(a1, a2):
    s = a1+a2
    res = ""
    for x in s:
        if x not in res:
            res += x
    return sort(res)
```

```python
# Short
def longest(a1, a2):
    return "".join(sorted(set(a1+a2)))
```
