# Day 49: Not very secure

- [Not very secure | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/526dbd6c8c0eb53254000110)

## Problem description

You have to validate if a user input string is alphanumeric. The given string is not `nil/null/NULL/None`, so you don't have to check that.

The string has the following conditions to be alphanumeric:

- At least one character ("" is not valid)
- Allowed characters are uppercase / lowercase latin letters and digits from 0 to 9
- No whitespaces / underscore

### Examples

```text
"hello world_" -> False
"PassW0rd" -> True
"      " -> False
```

## Resolution

Using the regular expression `^[a-zA-Z\d]+$` we can:

- `^` match the beggining of the string
- `[a-z]` match any letter in the range a-z
- `[A-Z]` match any letter in the range A-Z
- `[\d]` match any digit 0-9
- `+` look for one or more of the preceding construction
- `$` match the end of the string

## Code

```python
import re

alphanumeric = lambda pwd: re.match("^[a-zA-Z\d]+$", pwd) != None
```
