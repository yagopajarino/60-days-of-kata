# Day 50: Can you get the loop ?

- [Can you get the loop ? | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52a89c2ea8ddc5547a000863)

## Problem description

You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list always contains a tail and a loop. Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.

```python
# Use the `next' attribute to get the following node
node.next
```

The nodes can't be mutated.

### Examples

For example in the following picture the tail's size is 3 and the loop size is 12.

## Resolution

The only we can use is the node.next method, therefore we must follow the chain and save the nodes in a `past_nodes` set until the current node is included in the set.

Then using this found node as root, we can follow the chain counting the number of nodes in the loop.

## Code

```python
def loop_size(node):
    past_nodes = set()
    root = node
    node = node.next
    while root != node:
        if node in past_nodes:
            root = node
        else:
            past_nodes.add(node)
            node = node.next

    count = 1
    node = root.next
    while node != root:
        count += 1
        node = node.next
    return count
```
