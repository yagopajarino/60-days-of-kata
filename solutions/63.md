# Day 63: Do I get a bonus?

- [Do I get a bonus? | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56f6ad906b88de513f000d96)

## Problem description

It's bonus time in the big city! The fatcats are rubbing their paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money?

Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.

If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.

### Examples

```text
(10000, True) -> '$100000'
(25000, True) -> '$250000'
(60000, False) -> '$60000'
```

## Resolution

Check if the bonus is true, if so, return the salary multiplied by 10, otherwise return the salary. Both outputs parsed as string with the $ sign in it.

## Code

```python
def parse_salary(n):
    return "$" + str(n)

def bonus_time(salary, bonus):
    if bonus:
        return parse_salary(salary * 10)
    else:
        return parse_salary(salary)
```
