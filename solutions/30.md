# Day 30: Scramblies

- [Scramblies | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55c04b4cc56a697bb0000048)

## Problem description

Complete the function `scramble(str1, str2)` that returns `true` if a portion of `str1` characters can be rearranged to match `str2`, otherwise returns `false`.

### Examples

```text
'rkqodlw', 'world' -> True
'cedewaraaossoqqyt', 'codewars' -> True
'katas', 'steak' -> False
```

## Resolution

The small notes at the bottom of the problem said something like _"performance needs to be considered"_

At first I tried with a solution like for each char in `s2` count it's appearances on `s2` and in `s1`, return true if the latest is equal or greater.

Implemented something like that and got an runtime error, my algorithm was not as eficient as needed. In fact it a $O(n.m)$

So I came up with another aproach, making two list that count the appearances of each alphabetic char in each string.

After that the only thing I had to do was comparing if the i-th position in the second one was less or equal to the i-th position on the first one. Getting a $O(max(n,m,58))$

## Code

```python
def scramble(s1, s2):
    a = [0] * 58
    b = [0] * 58

    for x in s1:
        a[ord(x) - 65] += 1

    for x in s2:
        b[ord(x) - 65] += 1

    i = 0
    while i < 58 and b[i] <= a[i]:
        i += 1
    return i == 58
```
