# Day 19: Exes and Ohs

- [Exes and Ohs | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55908aad6620c066bc00002a)

## Problem description

Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

### Examples

```text
"ooxx" -> true
"xooxx -> false
"ooxXm" -> true
"zpzpzpp" -> true
"zzoo" -> false
```

## Resolution

Create a variable `res` that will count the number of xs that doesn't have a "o" at any given point.

Iterate over the lowercase string and for each char, if it's `"x"` add one to `res` if it's `"o"` subtract one to `res`

Return the boolean result of `res == 0`

## Code

```python
def xo(s):
    res = 0
    for c in s.lower():
        if c == "x":
            res += 1
        elif c == "o":
            res += -1
    return res == 0
```
