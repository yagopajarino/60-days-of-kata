# Day 4: Build Tower

- [Build Tower | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/576757b1df89ecf5bd00073b)

## Problem description

Given a non negative integer `number of floors`, return an array with the floors of a pyramid-shaped tower.

For `number of floors = 3` should return

```text
[
  "  *  ",
  " *** ",
  "*****"
]
```

And for `number of floors = 6` should return

```text
[
  "     *     ",
  "    ***    ",
  "   *****   ",
  "  *******  ",
  " ********* ",
  "***********"
]
```

## Resolution

Using some pen and paper I realized that:

- For the i-th floor (zero based), there will be $2*i - 1$ `"*"` and the rest will be blank `" "` spaces.
- Each floor has equal number of chars.
- The total amount of chars per floor is $n * 2 - 1$ where $n$ is the number of floors.

So the algorithm takes an integer `n_floors`, calculates the `CHARS_PER_FLOOR` constant and then builds each row of the pyramid.

## Code

```python
def tower_builder(n_floors):
    res = []
    CHARS_PER_FLOOR = n_floors * 2 - 1
    for x in range(n_floors):
        ast = 2*x+1
        blanks = int((CHARS_PER_FLOOR - ast) / 2)
        res.append(" " * blanks + "*" * ast + " " * blanks)
    return res
```
