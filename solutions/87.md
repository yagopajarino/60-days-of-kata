# Day 87: +1 Array

- [Fizz Buzz | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5300901726d12b80e8000498)

## Problem description

Given an array of integers of any length, return an array that has 1 added to the value represented by the array.

- the array can't be empty
- only non-negative, single digit integers are allowed

Return `nil` (or your language's equivalent) for invalid inputs.

### Examples

```text
[2, 3, 9] -> [2, 4, 0]
[4, 3, 2, 5] -> [4, 3, 2, 6]
```

## Resolution

First create a function `valid_array` to check that the given array meets the conditions to be a valid input.

Then with the numbers in the array, create an integer, add one to it and return the list of it's digits.

## Code

```python
def valid_array(a):
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) and a[i] < 10 and a[i] >= 0:
        i += 1
    return len(a) > 0 and i == len(a)

def up_array(arr):
    if valid_array(arr):
        n = int("".join(str(x) for x in arr))
        return [int(x) for x in str(n+1)]
    else:
        return None
```
