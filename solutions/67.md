- [CamelCase Method | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/587731fda577b3d1b0001196)

## Problem description

Write simple `.camelCase` method for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized without spaces.

### Examples

```text
"hello case" -> HelloCase
"camel case word" -> CamelCaseWord
```

## Resolution

Create an array with the string's words and then join them capitalized.

## Code

```python
def camel_case(string):
    return "".join([x.capitalize() for x in string.split(" ")])
```
