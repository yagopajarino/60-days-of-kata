# Day 82: Delete occurrences of an element if it occurs more than n times

- [Delete occurrences of an element if it occurs more than n times | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/554ca54ffa7d91b236000023)

## Problem description

Given a list and a number, create a new list that contains each number of list at most N times, without reordering.

For example if the input number is 2, and the input list is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].

With list [20,37,20,21] and number 1, the result would be [20,37,21].

### Examples

```text
[20,37,20,21] -> 1
[1,1,3,3,7,2,2,2,2] -> 3
```

## Resolution

For each item in the array, check if it's in a keys set, if so check the counter of that value and add it to a res array. Otherwise add it to the jeys set, initialize it's counter to 1 and add it to the res array.

## Code

```python
def delete_nth(order,max_e):
    keys = set()
    counter = {}
    res = []
    for x in order:
        if x not in keys:
            res.append(x)
            counter[x] = 1
            keys.add(x)
        else:
            if counter[x] < max_e:
                res.append(x)
                counter[x] += 1
    return res
```
