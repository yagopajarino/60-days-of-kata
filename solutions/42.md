# Day 42: Row Weights

- [Row Weights | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5abd66a5ccfd1130b30000a9)

## Problem description

Several people are standing in a row divided into two teams.
The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1, and so on.

Given an array of positive integers (the weights of the people), return a new array/tuple of two integers, where the first one is the total weight of team 1, and the second one is the total weight of team 2.

### Examples

```text
[13, 27, 49] -> (62, 27)
[50, 60, 70, 80] -> (120, 140)
[80] -> (80, 0)
```

## Resolution

Save in a variable `p` the sum of all integers in even positions of the array.

Then return the tuple made of `(p, t-p)` where `t` is the sum of all values in the given array.

## Code

```python
def row_weights(array):
    p = 0
    for x in range(len(array)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            p += array[x]
    return (p , sum(array) - p)
```
